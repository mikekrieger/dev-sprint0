# Text answers from Week 0

# Name:



Explain what each of the following lines does. Use the terminology you learned from the book (or Google)
	
	from TurtleWorld import *
	world = TurtleWorld() 
	bob = Turtle() 
	wait_for_user() 

Answer:
1. Imports functions into module.
2. Idenfities TurtleWorld as the program.
3. Tells python that bob is the name of the Turtle.
4. Tells python to wait for a command from the user.


These questions pertain to the program you wrote in Week0.

-- What are the arguments of polygon()?  What type is each argument?
Answer: t (turtle which is also bob) n (number of sides) length (length of each side)

-- What two turtle functions did you use to draw the sides of the polygon?
Answer: square and polyline

-- What are the arguments for polyline?  What type is each argument?
Answer: t (turtle) n (number of sides) length (length of each side) angle (angle of polygon)





Suppose you wrote a function, center_circle(), that draws a circle of a given radius around the current location of the turtle and restores the turtle to its starting point.

-- What turtle functions would you use to move the turtle from the center to the edge of the circle and get ready to call the original circle() function?
Answer: arc(t,r,angle)
move(bob,r)

-- Suppose the interface of this function requires the turtle to end up in the same place it started, facing in the same direction it started.
Answer: lt(t, angle)

-- What is this type of requirement called?
Answer: paramater
